## What is Go PomoTimer?

Go PomoTimer is a free online pomodoro timer that combines simplicity with powerful features for desktop & mobile browsers. You can work more efficiently, maintain focus, and complete tasks more quickly. It divides work into periods (pomodoros) with brief breaks.  

Go PomoTimer goes beyond a basic timer. It allows:
- Customization of session lengths and break times
- Adding tasks that can be saved and synced across devices
- Beautiful themes to personalize your workspace
- Detailed statistics to monitor progress over time

Whether you are managing a single project or juggling multiple tasks, Go PomoTimer helps you stay on track and make the most of your focused work sessions.  

We also organize events from time to time to help users connect, learn, and stay motivated.  

The method was created by **Francesco Cirillo** in the late 1980s when he used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer (*pomodoro* is Italian for tomato) to study without drifting.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time-management method created by **Francesco Cirillo** in the late 1980s. The approach involves using a timer to divide work into focused intervals, usually **25 minutes**, followed by short breaks. Each interval is called a *pomodoro*, named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used.  

The technique is popular thanks to apps and websites offering built-in timers and guidance. It is closely related to **timeboxing** and aligns well with iterative and incremental workflows used in software development, making it useful in **pair programming** and similar practices.

## How Does a Pomodoro Timer Work?

1. Set a timer for **25 minutes**. Pick the number of tasks to complete.  
2. Work until the timer rings. Ignore tabs, notifications, and unnecessary detours.  
3. Take a **5-minute break**. Stand up, sip water, or close your eyes.  
4. Repeat rounds. Go PomoTimer provides up to **20 rounds** in one sitting, then take a longer break to reset your brain.

### The Practical Logic Behind It

- **Timeboxing** gives your brain edges. A 25-minute box tells you "Just get through this slice" so the task feels smaller.  
- **Parkinson's Law** says work expands to fill the time given. Shrink the time, and the work often shrinks with it.  
- Short breaks **restore attention**. A quick step away refreshes your mind for the next round.  
- You get a **tiny dopamine hit** when the timer dings and you mark a round done, fueling motivation.

## How Do I Use the Go PomoTimer Online?

A Pomodoro timer counts down to a concentrated work session, notifies you when it is over, and then initiates a brief break. Take a longer break to recover after four Pomodoros.
